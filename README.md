3. VANETs
      
      Procedure:
      
        1. Establishing Connection between Vehicle and Traffic Control Server.
        2. Data exchange between Vehicle and Server.
        3. Increasing Vehicle Count.
        4. Comparing Vehicle Count with specified thresholds. If the count crossed a particular threshold, then Congestion protocol 
           is applied, signal is changed to green for a specific duration.
        5. Closing connection after vehicle crosses the junction, decrementing vehicle count and re-comparing with the 
           specified thresholds.
